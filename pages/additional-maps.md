<h2 id="Additional-Metadata">Additional Maps</h2>

<p>Because copyright permissions could not be obtained for all maps in our collection within the timeframe of this project, I have included a list of other maps of interest in the Koerner Library's map collection here. The table below provides sorting and basic search of the additional maps, including a link to their record in the UBC database, if available. </p>
