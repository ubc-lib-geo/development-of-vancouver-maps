## Recognizing the Indigenous Context

In creating this project, I recognize that the maps used depict the very recent displacement of individuals and communities in a colonialized context. The maps in this collection do not show the historical displacement of the people of the xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam), Sḵwx̱wú7mesh (Squamish), and Sel̓íl̓witulh (Tsleil-Waututh) Nations, who have cared for these lands for thousands of years. 

Furthermore, the maps in this collection are drawn from a Western perspective, and therefore emphasize details aligned with that perspective including infrastructure such as roads, buildings, and landmarks. 

In understanding this collection, it is important to recognize the power that maps have: “As a political technology, mapping has long played a key role in the world-making practices of colonialism through the appropriation, demarcation, naming, and partitioning of territory as part of the process of colonization and the assertion of imperial rule over peoples and places [(Rose-Redwood et al., 2020)](/maps-colleciton/citations.html). 

Consequently, in creating this map collection, I recognize that these maps do not and cannot tell a full story of the entirety of the displacement of Indigenous peoples in Vancouver. 
To better understand the displacement of Indigenous peoples in Vancouver and mapping from Indigenous perspectives, I recommend the following resources:
