## Zoning and Local Area Maps
These maps show the dwelling sizes, commercial, industrial, historical, and agricultural districts of Vancouver. By comparing these maps between key years (for example, the 1970s and 1980s), differences in density and dwelling types can provide evidence of gentrification in specific neighbourhoods. 

See all [zoning](/browse.html#zoning) or [area](/browse.html#local%20area) maps. Remember that you may be able to find more relevant maps in the [Additional Maps](/additional-maps.html) page.

## Transportation Maps
Maps that show transportation including public transportation, bike paths, railways, and roadways may have varying connections to gentrification. For example, “elevated highways are … a barrier for investment, thereby limiting the potential for gentrification” [(Tolfo & Doucet, 2022)](/citations.html). Furthermore, neighbourhoods connected to transportation such as the SkyTrain that allows access to downtown could be areas targeted for gentrification.

See all [transportation](/browse.html#transportation) maps. Remember that you may be able to find more relevant maps in the [Additional Maps](/additional-maps.html) page.

## Census Tracts
The change in census tracts can show the change in density of population or can be used to compare change in median income of different census tracts (which can be found through Statistics Canada) to show the gentrification of an area. For example, in the 1980s, there were about a dozen census tracts in Vancouver’s downtown that formed Vancouver’s largest concentration of poverty; by 2016, this reduced to five census tracts [(Tolfo & Doucet, 2022)](/citations.html).

See all [census tracts](/browse.html#census%20districts) maps. Remember that you may be able to find more relevant maps in the [Additional Maps](/additional-maps.html) page.

## Maps of Parks
Creation or maintenance of parks may be associated with the gentrification of a neighbourhood; for example, following an increase in density of population due to condominium developments in the North False Creek area in the 2000s, some residents complained of decreased livability due to not enough amenities to support the growing population. In response, the City of Vancouver re-established park space [(Tolfo & Doucet, 2022).](/citations.html)

Unfortunately, we could not provide access to any images of park maps. Remember that you may be able to find more relevant maps in the [Additional Maps](/additional-maps.html) page.


## Industrial and Noise Pollution Maps
Areas with industrial sites, pollution (including noise), or other externalities that are deemed “unpleasant” are often areas that are targeted by city planners for gentrification(Ley & Dobson, 2008); especially in the post war years of the 1960s and 1970s, public opinion turned against some of Vancouver’s oldest, often industrial neighbourhoods, and they were targeted for redevelopment [(Tolfo & Doucet, 2022)](/citations.html). 

Unfortunately, we could not provide access to any images of industrial or noise pollution maps. Remember that you may be able to find more relevant maps in the [Additional Maps](/additional-maps.html) page.
